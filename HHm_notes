# HHM

## What are HHM?

- Probabilistic Models linking raw observation with abstract representation.
- A combination of probabilities which represent the possible states modeling something

HMM can link the variation in the amounts of protein and current state of the promoter.

Finding hidden sequence of states
--> s^T s= number of states and T= time ;; so state combos grow exp
